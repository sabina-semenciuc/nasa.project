## A. Data collection
### Part 1: Get the data via GET requests and create a dataframe.
### Part 2: Data cleaning/wrangling.

(rewriting the df to only contain the main columns, extracting the information from the links associted, formatting the date column, etc.)
### Part 3: Filter the dataframe to only include falcon 9 releases.
### Part 4: Final adjustments and file download.
(replacing missing values, downloading the file)

OUTPUT: dataset_part_1



## B. Exploratory data analysis
### Part 1: Calculate the number of releases on each platform.
### Part 2: Calculate the number of launches for each orbit.
### Part 3: Calculate the number of different landing results, distinguish successful from unsuccessful ones.
### Part 4: Create a Class column using LandingOutcome.
### Part 5: Using the Class column.
(calculating average, grouping by orbit and class, counting)

OUTPUT: dataset_part_2


## C. Data analysis using SQL
### Part 1: Upload the data to the database
### Part 2: Queries with SQL
(10 exercices)



## D. Data visualization
### Part 1: Visualize the relationship between the flight number and the takeoff platform.
### Part 2: Visualize the relationship between the mass of the load and the platform.
### Part 3: Visualize the relationship between number of flights and orbit.
### Part 4: Visualize the relationship between orbit and mass of the charge.
### Part 5: Visualize the likelihood of success according to the platform
### Part 6: Visualization of the probability of success in each month.
### Part 7: Visualization of the probability of success over time.


## E. Interactive Visual Analytics of launch site locations with Folium
### Part 1: Mark all launching sites on a map.
### Part 2: Mark on the map the successful/failed launches of each site.
### Part 3: Calculate the distances between a launch site and its vicinity.
